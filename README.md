By adopting these strategies and practices, we can significantly improve the uptime and availability of the web application, ensuring it remains operational even in the face of disasters or unexpected failures.

  

**There will be some sale days in the month when the traffic will be spiked from took DAU to 120-150k users.**

  

To handle the spike in traffic during sale days when the number of daily active users (DAU) increases to 120-150k, you can implement the following strategies:

  

- Auto-scaling:

	- We will set up auto-scaling policies for your web application's infrastructure. During normal days, the application can run on a minimal number of instances to save costs. However, when the traffic increases during sale days, the auto-scaling policies will automatically add more instances to handle the increased load. This ensures that your application can handle the surge in traffic without manual intervention.

- Load Testing and Performance Optimization:

	- Conduct load testing in advance to identify the performance bottlenecks in your application. Optimize your code, database queries, and caching mechanisms to ensure the application can handle the expected load during the sale days.

- CDN and Caching:

	- Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to cache and serve static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript from edge locations. This reduces the load on your web servers and improves response times. Implement caching mechanisms for dynamic content to reduce the load on our database.

- Asynchronous Processing:

	- Offload resource-intensive tasks to background jobs or queues. For example, if certain processes are not time-sensitive, we can queue them for processing later instead of executing them synchronously during the sale days.

- Feature Toggling:

	- Use feature toggles to enable or disable certain features of your application during peak times. You can disable non-essential features or limit access to certain functionalities to manage the load effectively.

- Pre-warming:
	
	- Pre-warm our cache and infrastructure before the sale starts. This involves loading frequently accessed data into the cache and ensuring that additional instances are already running before the traffic surge.

- Proactive Monitoring:

	- Implement proactive monitoring and alerting to detect any anomalies or performance issues in real-time. This allows us to identify and resolve issues quickly, reducing the impact on users during peak times.

- Load Balancing:

	- We will use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic among multiple instances. This helps evenly distribute the load and prevent any single instance from becoming overwhelmed.

- Disaster Recovery Plan:

	- We will have a disaster recovery plan in place to handle any unforeseen issues during the sale days. This includes regular backups, redundant systems, and a plan for rolling back changes if needed.

  

By implementing these strategies, we can ensure that our web application can handle the increased traffic during sale days without any downtime or performance degradation, providing a smooth and seamless shopping experience for our users.

  

**The app has to globally serve the customers across the globe and the catalogue will be different for different countries.**

  

To solve the requirement of globally serving customers across the globe with different catalogues for different countries, we will follow these steps:

  

- Multi-Region Deployment:

	- Deploy the application in multiple regions using AWS. Each region should have its own set of servers, databases, and other necessary resources to handle user requests.

- Content Delivery Network (CDN):

	- Implement a CDN to cache and serve static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JS files) from edge locations close to the users. This reduces latency and improves the loading speed of the application for customers in different countries.

- Geo-Location Based Routing:

	- Use a geo-location based routing mechanism to direct user requests to the nearest data center or server. This ensures that customers are served from the region closest to their physical location, reducing response time.

- Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):

	- Implement i18n and l10n to support multiple languages and currencies based on user preferences. Detect the user's locale and present the appropriate version of the catalogue for their country and language.

- Country-Specific Catalogue Management:

	- Maintain separate catalogues or product databases for each country. The application should fetch the relevant catalogue based on the user's country or region.

- Currency Conversion:

	- Implement currency conversion for prices displayed to users in different countries. Use up-to-date exchange rates to dynamically convert prices to the user's preferred currency.

- Local Payment Gateways:

	- Integrate with local payment gateways and support payment methods commonly used in each country. This ensures that customers can make payments using familiar and preferred methods.

- Regional Compliance:

	- Ensure that the application complies with the data privacy regulations and legal requirements of each country where it operates.

  

By implementing these strategies, the application can effectively serve customers across the globe with a personalized and localized shopping experience, tailored to the preferences and needs of users in different countries.

  

**All the payments and user data should be securely stored and accessed.**

  

To ensure that all payments and user data are securely stored and accessed, you can implement several security measures in your web application development process. Here are some key steps to address this requirement:

  

- Encryption:

	- Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) to encrypt sensitive data such as passwords, payment details, and personal information.

	- Employ transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit, ensuring secure communication between the user's browser and the server.

	  

- Secure Authentication:

	- Implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.

	- Store user passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) with salting to protect against password attacks.

	  

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
	
	- Implement RBAC to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles and permissions.

	- Limit access to sensitive data and functions only to authorized personnel.

	  

- Data Privacy Compliance:

	- Comply with relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, to protect user data and privacy rights.

	- Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data.

	  

- Secure Payment Gateway Integration:

	- Use trusted and PCI DSS-compliant payment gateways to handle payment transactions securely.

	- Avoid storing sensitive payment information on your server and rely on tokenization provided by the payment gateway.

  

- Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:

	- Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

	- Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and validate the effectiveness of your security measures.

  

- Data Access Controls:

	- Implement strict access controls to limit the number of personnel who can access sensitive data.

	- Use secure protocols for remote access, such as VPN, and implement IP whitelisting to restrict access to authorized locations.

	  

- Secure Coding Practices:

	- Train your development team in secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

	- Use security libraries and frameworks to prevent security flaws.

	  

- Regular Security Updates:

	- Keep all software, libraries, and dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

	- Implement a process to quickly respond to security advisories and apply patches promptly.

	  

- Data Backup and Disaster Recovery:

	- Regularly back up user data and store it securely in multiple locations to ensure data recovery in case of any disasters or data breaches.

	  

By incorporating these security measures, you can establish a robust security posture for your web application, safeguarding user data and ensuring secure payment processing for your customers. It's crucial to continually review and update your security practices to stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain a secure environment for your users.

## Repository branching strategy:

### Gitflow Branching Strategy:

Gitflow is a branching model that provides a structured approach to managing branches and releases.

**Main Branch:**

The main branch contains the production-ready code. It is always in a stable state and represents the latest released version of the software.

**Develop Branch:**

The develop branch is used as the integration branch for ongoing development work. Developers create feature branches from the develop branch and merge their changes back into it once the feature is complete.

**Feature Branches:**

Feature branches are created by developers from the develop branch. Each feature branch represents a single new feature or improvement. Once the feature is complete and tested, it is merged back into the develop branch.

**Release Branches:**

Release branches are created from the develop branch when the team is preparing for a new release. The release branch is used for final testing, bug fixing, and preparing the release. Once the release is ready, it is merged into both the main and develop branches.

**Hotfix Branches:**

Hotfix branches are used to address critical issues in the production code. They are created from the main branch and, once the fix is applied, merged back into both the main and develop branches.

The typical flow of work in the Gitflow branching strategy is as follows:

1. Developers create feature branches from the develop branch to work on new features or changes.

2. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the develop branch for integration testing.

3. When the team is preparing for a new release, a release branch is created from the develop branch.

4. The release branch undergoes final testing and bug fixing, and once it's ready, it is merged into both the main and develop branches.

5. If critical issues are discovered in the main branch, hotfix branches are created to address them. Once fixed, hotfixes are merged back into both the main and develop branches.

## DevOps Deployment strategy

We will be following the Ramped deployment strategy while deploying our code in production release.

### Ramped Deployment

Ramped deployment is a deployment strategy that focuses on gradually rolling out new releases or updates to a software system, rather than deploying them to all users at once. This strategy is also known as a phased or incremental deployment. The goal of ramped deployment is to minimize risks and disruptions associated with large-scale deployments by incrementally introducing changes and monitoring their impact on the system and users.

**Key Steps in Ramped Deployment Strategy:**

**Deployment Planning:**

The first step is to plan the deployment process. This involves defining the phases of deployment, determining the criteria for progressing to the next phase, and setting up monitoring and rollback mechanisms.

**Phases of Deployment:**

In a ramped deployment strategy, the deployment process is divided into multiple phases. Each phase includes a subset of users or systems to receive the new release.

**Initial Deployment:**

The initial phase involves deploying the new release to a small subset of users or systems. These users are often internal team members or a limited group of early adopters.

**Monitoring and Validation:**

During each phase of deployment, the system's performance, stability, and user feedback are closely monitored. This helps to identify any issues or unexpected behavior early on.

**Incremental Expansion:**

If the initial phase is successful and no critical issues are detected, the deployment is expanded to a larger subset of users or systems. This expansion continues gradually, increasing the number of users with each subsequent phase.

**Rollback Plan:**

It's crucial to have a rollback plan in place in case any severe issues arise during deployment. If problems are detected, the deployment can be rolled back to a previous version to minimize the impact on users.

**Steady State and Completion:**

The ramped deployment process continues until the new release is deployed to all users or systems. Once the deployment is complete, the system reaches a steady state, and further monitoring ensures that everything is functioning as expected.

**Benefits of Ramped Deployment:**

**Risk Mitigation:**

Ramped deployment reduces the risk associated with large-scale deployments. By gradually introducing changes, issues can be detected and resolved early, minimizing the impact on users.

**Continuous Monitoring:**

The deployment strategy allows for continuous monitoring of system performance and user feedback, ensuring that any issues are addressed promptly.

**User Feedback:**

Early deployment to a limited user group allows for valuable feedback, which can be used to make improvements before rolling out the update to a broader audience.

**Flexibility:**

The phased approach provides flexibility to adjust the deployment plan based on real-time feedback and observations during each phase.

**Improved User Experience:**

By monitoring and addressing issues early, ramped deployment aims to provide a smoother and more seamless user experience during the update process.

**Rollback Capability:**

Having a rollback plan ensures that if critical issues are encountered, the deployment can be quickly reverted to a previous stable version.

Ramped deployment is particularly useful for large, complex systems with a significant user base, as it helps ensure a smooth and successful update process while minimizing disruptions. It is a popular deployment strategy in scenarios where system reliability and user experience are critical considerations.

This strategy gives zero downtime and also enables performance monitoring. Nevertheless, the rollback duration is long in case there is an unexpected event. This is because the downgrading process to the initial version follows the same cycle, one instance at a time.
